# Kitchen Stuff

A simple shopping cart in **Vanilla Javascript**.


## Styling 
I have used **SCSS** for styling.

## Animations
They have been implemented using the library **GSAP**. 

## Data
Iâ€™m retrieving data from **Contentful** using their **Content Delivery API**.

## Notes
This is a demonstration of how a shopping cart can be implemented just on the Front End using the browser's **Local Storage**

Thanks for your time!
